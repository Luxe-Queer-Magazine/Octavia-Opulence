# Ghost CMS Research for Luxe Queer Magazine

## Overview of Ghost CMS
Ghost is an all-in-one platform designed for independent publishers and media businesses. It provides tools for content management, subscriber collection, newsletter distribution, premium content publishing, and recurring revenue generation.

### Key Features
- **Professional Publishing Platform**: Ghost offers a clean, efficient interface for content creators and publishers
- **Powerful Editorial Experience**: The editor provides a streamlined workflow for both authors and developers
- **Custom Branding**: Allows for creation of a distinct editorial brand with customizable design elements
- **Subscription Management**: Supports premium tiers with both monthly and yearly billing options
- **Team Collaboration**: Provides separate staff accounts with different permission levels
- **Content Export**: Allows export of all content in JSON format
- **Newsletter Integration**: Built-in newsletter functionality with subscriber management

## Print Publication Workflow Options

Since Ghost is primarily designed as a digital publishing platform, creating a print publication workflow requires additional steps and possibly third-party integrations. Here are the options identified:

### 1. Content Export and Manual Layout
- Export content from Ghost in JSON format
- Import content into a desktop publishing software (InDesign, Affinity Publisher, etc.)
- Manually design and layout the print magazine
- Export as print-ready PDF

### 2. PDF Generation Options
- **Direct PDF Links**: Ghost allows uploading and linking to PDF files
- **PDF Embedding**: Can embed PDFs directly in Ghost content using HTML cards
- **Automation with Zapier**: Previously, Zapier integration with Google Cloud Print was suggested for automatic PDF conversion, but Google Cloud Print has been discontinued

### 3. Potential Third-Party Solutions
- Investigate specialized print-to-digital services that can convert web content to print-ready formats
- Consider custom development of a Ghost-to-InDesign or Ghost-to-PDF workflow
- Explore print-on-demand services that can integrate with web content
