## Company Overview

### Mission Statement
To transform luxury publishing by centering queer perspectives, celebrating authenticity, and redefining opulence through a distinctly queer lens.

### Vision
To become the definitive global voice at the intersection of luxury and queer identity, creating a publication as multifaceted and brilliant as our community.

### Legal Structure
Luxe Queer will be established as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), balancing profit with purpose and allowing for investment while maintaining our commitment to the LGBTQ+ community.

### Company History
Luxe Queer was conceived as a response to the lack of authentic queer representation in luxury publishing. Traditional luxury magazines have begun to include queer content, but often as tokenistic additions rather than foundational perspectives. Luxe Queer inverts this paradigm, placing queer perspectives at the center of luxury discourse.
