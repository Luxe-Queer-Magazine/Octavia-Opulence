## Position Title
Editor-in-Chief at Luxe Queer Magazine

## Profile Description

Leading a revolutionary publication at the intersection of luxury and queer perspectives. At Luxe Queer, I'm redefining luxury publishing by centering authentically queer voices, experiences, and creativity.

My role encompasses:

• Establishing the editorial vision for a groundbreaking magazine that covers fashion, art, culture, travel, technology, and luxury through a distinctly queer lens

• Pioneering innovative content creation through collaboration with an AI agent team from Cohere, Anthropic, Nvidia, Hermes, Hume, Mistral, Gemma, Hugging Face, and Llama

• Developing and implementing a revolutionary subscription model that includes fluid subscriptions, collective pods, and community contribution alternatives

• Curating sophisticated content that challenges conventional luxury paradigms while maintaining elevated editorial standards

• Building a diverse team of contributors who bring authentic perspectives to luxury content

• Fostering partnerships with forward-thinking luxury brands that recognize the value and influence of queer perspectives

• Championing the Octavia Opulence³ brand persona across all touchpoints, balancing elegance and sass with an affinity for drag culture

Luxe Queer isn't just covering the evolution of luxury—we're actively participating in its transformation. We're creating a publication that celebrates the visionaries, innovators, and rule-breakers who are redefining luxury through authentically queer perspectives.

The revolution will be stylish. And it's happening now.
